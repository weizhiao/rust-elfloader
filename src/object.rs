//! ELF object representations and access traits
//!
//! This module provides traits and implementations for accessing ELF objects,
//! whether they are stored in memory or in files. It abstracts the data source
//! to allow uniform handling of different ELF object types during the loading
//! and relocation process.

/// A trait representing an ELF object that can be read from.
///
/// This trait provides a uniform interface for accessing ELF data regardless
/// of its storage medium (memory, file, etc.). Implementors of this trait
/// can be used as data sources for ELF loading operations.
///
/// The trait is designed to abstract away the underlying storage mechanism
/// while providing efficient access to the ELF data. This allows the ELF
/// loader to work with various data sources without needing to know the
/// specifics of how the data is stored or accessed.
pub trait ElfObject {
    /// Returns the name of the ELF object.
    ///
    /// This is typically the file path or a descriptive name for the object.
    /// The name is used for error reporting and debugging purposes.
    ///
    /// # Returns
    /// A C string reference containing the object's name.
    fn file_name(&self) -> &CStr;

    /// Reads data from the ELF object into a buffer.
    ///
    /// This method reads a specified number of bytes from the ELF object
    /// starting at a given offset and copies them into the provided buffer.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    /// * `buf` - A mutable slice where the read data will be stored.
    ///           The length of this buffer determines how many bytes to read.
    /// * `offset` - The byte offset within the ELF object where reading begins.
    ///
    /// # Returns
    /// * `Ok(())` - If the read operation was successful.
    /// * `Err` - If the read operation failed (e.g., I/O error, invalid offset).
    ///
    /// # Examples
    /// ```rust,ignore
    /// let mut buffer = [0u8; 64];
    /// elf_object.read(&mut buffer, 0x100)?; // Read 64 bytes starting at offset 0x100
    /// ```

    /// For file-based ELF objects, this method returns the underlying file
    /// descriptor which can be used for memory mapping operations. For
    /// memory-based objects, this method returns `None`.
    ///
    /// This is particularly useful for optimizing file I/O by enabling
    /// memory mapping when possible, rather than reading file contents
    /// into buffers.

/// are preferred, such as in async runtime contexts.

/// # Safety
/// Implementors must ensure that the async operations are properly implemented

/// used across thread boundaries.
