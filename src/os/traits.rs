/// A trait for low-level memory mapping operations.
///
/// This trait provides a unified interface for memory-mapped I/O and anonymous memory allocation.
/// It abstracts platform-specific details, allowing the ELF loader to work across different systems.
///
/// # Safety
/// All methods are unsafe because they manipulate the process's virtual address space.
/// Improper use can cause memory corruption, crashes, or security vulnerabilities.
/// Implementors must ensure thread-safety and proper error handling.
///
/// # Example
/// ```rust,ignore
/// struct MyMmap;
///
/// unsafe impl Mmap for MyMmap {
///     unsafe fn mmap(
///         addr: Option<usize>,
///         len: usize,
///         prot: ProtFlags,
///         flags: MapFlags,
///         offset: usize,
///         fd: Option<isize>,
///         need_copy: &mut bool,
///     ) -> Result<NonNull<c_void>> {
///         // Platform-specific implementation
///         todo!()
///     }
///
///     // Implement other required methods...
/// }

    /// # Arguments
    /// * `addr` - Preferred starting address (page-aligned). `None` lets the system choose.

    /// * `offset` - File offset for file-backed mappings (must be page-aligned).
