//! Memory mapping operations for ELF loader
//!
//! This module provides traits and implementations for memory mapping operations
//! required by the ELF loader. It abstracts platform-specific memory management
//! to offer a unified interface for mapping, unmapping, and protecting memory regions.
//!
//! Key concepts:
//! - **Memory Mapping**: Allows files or data to be mapped directly into memory.
//! - **Protection Flags**: Control read, write, and execute permissions.
//! - **Mapping Flags**: Specify how the mapping behaves (e.g., private, fixed address).
//!
//! # Safety
//! Memory mapping involves direct manipulation of the process's address space.
//! Incorrect usage can cause crashes, data corruption, or security issues.
//! Always ensure proper bounds checking and permission handling.
